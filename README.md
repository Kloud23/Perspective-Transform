Here, I have tried to make the perspective transformation of photos more visual. Generally, the points in the original image and the coresponding points on the transformed image need to be selected by visual inspection and estimation. I have used openCV, matplotlib.pyplot and numpy techniques to achieve the same.

Following flow chart shows how to use the function defined in [Perspective_Transform.ipynb](Perspective_Transform.ipynb)
{.foo}

Following is the image that was used to demonstrate the function usage.
